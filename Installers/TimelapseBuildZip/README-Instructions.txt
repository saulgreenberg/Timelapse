(a link to that location is included in this folder).

The Timelapse-Executables folder contains three Timelapse executables 
- Timelapse.exe:               main Timelapse program for tagging your images as data
- TimelapseTemplateEditor.exe: open Timelapse in Template Editor mode to create your data fields.
- Timelapse-ViewOnly.exe:      open Timelapse in a mode where you can view but not change your data.

NOTE: Windows may ask you for permission before executing programs.
