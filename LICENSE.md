<B>Intended purpose. </B>Timelapse’s is a tool to simplify analysis of a huge number images and videos, usually captured from remote cameras. It lets end-users review and enter data describing those images (optionally assisted by image recognition). Timelapse is agnostic to what is being analyzed, as it allows end-users to create custom data fields to fit their particular purposes.

<B>Intended Timelapse users.</B> End-users are typically (but not always) ecologists, biologists, fishery scientists and their staff, as well as researchers and students investigating environmental issues for the public good. We are normally fine (and indeed encourage) the free use of Timelapse if it is being used by these or similar end-users for the public good.
