## Overview

Timelapse is a tool to simplify analysis of large numbers of images and videos, typically captured from remote cameras. It allows users to review and enter data describing those images, optionally assisted by image recognition. Timelapse is agnostic to what is being analyzed, as it allows users to create custom data fields to fit their particular purposes.

## Usage Guidelines

### Non-Commercial Use

Timelapse is freely available for non-commercial use by a broad audience, although its primary users are currently ecologists, biologists, fishery scientists, researchers, students, and similar users analyzing camera trap imagery for environmental research. We encourage the free use of Timelapse executables for these intended purposes, where the results are used for the public good.

Timelapse includes third-party components and executables, as listed in the Third-Party Components section along with a summary of their license and a link to their actual license. They all generally allow  non-commercial use, but it is your responsibility to check their license terms. 

### Source Code Modification

To comply with the license terms when modifying source code:
- Fork the project to your own open repository (similar to this one)
- Include this license (or at least a visible link to it) in your fork
- Receive no monetary compensation for the changes you make
- If you would like to work directly with the current repository, contact Saul Greenberg at saul@ucalgary.ca

### Commercial Use

**Commercial use requires prior arrangement.** Contact saul@ucalgary.ca to discuss your situation and, if required, licensing terms.

**IMPORTANT:** Even if granted permission to use Timelapse for commercial purposes, you are responsible for ensuring compliance with all third-party licenses (see below), which may require separate arrangements via their vendor.
