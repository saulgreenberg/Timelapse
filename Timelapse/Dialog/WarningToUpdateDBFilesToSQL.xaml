                            What="Version 2.3.0.0 onwards includes fixes to long-standing internal issues in Timelapse. Fixes are NOT backwards compatable.
                            [br]An upgrade dialog is available that searches for and asks you to upgrade pre-version 2.3.0.0 template [i].tdb[/i] and data [i].ddb[/i] files.
                            [br 10]Raise this dialog in one of two ways.
                            [ni]As you use Timelapse: the upgrade dialog appears whenever you try to open these older files.
                            [ni]By the Timelapse menu: [e]File | Upgrade Timelapse files (.tdb/.ddb) to latest version...[/e] raises the dialog, where you can choose the folder to search."
                            Result="The folder and sub-folders are searched for all older [i].tdb/.ddb files[/i], and each found file is upgraded.
                            [li]Your original [i].tdb[/i] and [i].ddb[/i] files are moved to its corresponding [i]Backups folder[/i], and are renamed to include a [i]Pre23[/i] suffix."
                            Details="The following changes may affect you.
                                      [li][e]ImageQuality[/e] field (which is rarely used) is renamed to a [e]Dark[/e] flag field with true/false values, or optionally deleted;
                                      [li][e]Exported CSV files[/e] will no longer have an 'ImageQuality' column, but may include a Dark column.
                                      [li][e]Dark[/e] classification is now done by populating a flag field of your choice (via Edit|Populate a field with Dark... );
                                      [li][e]DateTimes[/e] no longer use timezone offsets, and can be exported in different CSV formats (via Options|Preferences);
                                      [li][e]Folder[/e] field is optionally included in CSV exports as the renamed 'RootFolder' column (via Options|Preferences);
                                      [li][e]Importing data from previously generated CSV files[/e] may produce (easily repaired) warnings;
                                      [li][e]Redesigned internal database tables[/e]. If details are needed, see the Timelapse Database Guide on the web site."
                            Hint="Don't open upgraded files with old Timelapse versions, as Timelapse will crash and you will have to upgrade the files again."
